# Statzilla to the rescue! 

We've built this HTML5 time-killer game during [47hous](http://47hours.org/) 
hackathon to help users of [statzilla.ru](www.statzilla.ru) web services
have a good time while their we cook their data.

## Gameplay and controls

Player runs forward and collects data observations and bar plots, he must 
avoid bars that are larger then he to survive. 

Statzilla may be flipped over coordinate axis with **spacebar** on PC or with 
**tap** on mobile devices.

## Technology

This game was built with [phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) â€” an open-source
JS framework for building browser games.
